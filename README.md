# RPG Project

## Synopsis
The game we are developing is a role-playing game where monsters are attacking a village, and our protagonists must defeat them before it’s too late. The game will be a gauntlet of battles with the monsters becoming increasingly stronger as the game goes on. 

## Game Design
The gimmick for this game is that, unlike standard RPGs, you have to attack the opponent using a combination of buttons (rather than just clicking “Fireball” and dealing damage that way). You are even able to dodge their attacks as the animation occurs, giving the game a more action vibe. This RPG is simplified compared to others since the focus is on how you time your attacks, rather than what attacks you use. Still, there will be attacks good for one type of enemy, but bad for others.

There will be an inventory the player can access during battles to help them. Collectibles include potions for healing the characters and giving them more “action points” for their special attacks.

This game is inspired by the Mario & Luigi RPG series, which has the same gimmick as our game.

## Development Design
The game engine will use a model-view-controller architecture discussed in class. The model will involve the player and enemy sprites. The view will be the battle scene and it will change when, for example, an enemy is defeated, but there’s still two remaining. The controller will handle button inputs for attacking and dodging attacks. If we have enough time, there will be an overworld where the player can move in between battles with buttons such as the arrow keys. The overworld will also affect the view for this game as it is going to be a different environment from the battles.

## Technical Challenges
There has been some trouble downloading proper software to create the art for the game. Aesprite is not downloading properly. It is most likely something on my end as I can’t find any documentation of the issue I was having.

In addition, the jump was difficult to implement, and will be worked on more.

## Division of Labor
Sydney: Art creation and level design

Sean: Game Engine focused

## Timeline
### Milestone 1: March 30
#### Sydney:
I collected some reference for the environment and created sketches for us to choose from to then be quickly made in a pixel art creation software
#### Sean:
Mostly worked on the battle scene. The game mechanics will remain the same, but I need to make more progress. Some things might be removed from the final version, such as the overworld.

### Milestone 2: April 12
#### Sydney:
All level designs have been implemented and finalized all artwork is on its final iteration ready for final playtesting and debugging
#### Sean: 
Have different types of enemies implemented with different attacks

### Final Game Submission: April 26
### Final Exam Presentation: May 4
